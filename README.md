`wgd v2` is a python package upgraded from the original `wgd` package aiming for the inference and timing of ancient whole-genome duplication (WGD) events. For the propose of illustrating the principle and usage of `wgd v2`, we compiled this documentation. Below we first give an introduction over the scope and mechanism of `wgd v2` and then the practical information of installation and usage. An examplar workflow is provided in the tutorial section on how to seek evidence for a putative WGD event and perform proper timing with a freshly obtained genome assembly in hand. For those who are interested, we recommend turning to our paper and book chapter for more detailed description and insightful discussions. If you use `wgd v2` in your research, please cite us. 

## Introduction

Polyploidizations, the evolutionary process that the entire genome of an organism is duplicated, also named as whole-genome duplications (WGDs), occur recurrently across the tree of life. There are two modes of polyploidizations, autopolyploidizations and allopolyploidizations. Autopolyploidizations are the duplication of the same genome, resulting in two identical subgenomes at the time it emerged. While the allopolyploidizations are normally achieved in two steps, first the hybridization between two different species, resulting in the arising of transient homoploidy,second the duplication of the homoploidy, resulting in the emergence of allopolyploidy. Due to the unstability and unbalanced tetrasomic inheritance, for instance the nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibility, the polyploidy genome will then experience a process called diploidization, also named as fractionation, during which a large portion of gene duplicates will get lost and only a fraction can be retained. The traces of polyploidizations can be thus unearthed from these retained gene duplicates. Three approaches based on gene duplicates, namely, *K*<sub>S</sub> method, gene tree - species tree reconciliation method and synteny method, are commonly used in detecting evidence for WGDs. The gene tree - species tree reconciliation method is not within the scope of `wgd v2`, but we kindly refer readers who are interested to the phylogenomic program developed by Arthur Zwaenepoel named [WHALE](https://github.com/arzwa/Whale.jl) and the associated [paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msz088) for more technical and theoretical details.

The *K*<sub>S</sub> method is established on a model of gene family evolution that each gene family is allowed to evolve via gene duplication and loss. Note that the gene family here is assumed to be the cluster of all genes descended from an ancestral gene in a single genome. Recovering the gene tree of such gene family informs the timing, scilicet the age, of gene duplication events. The age refered here, is not in real geological time, but in the unit of evolutionary distance, i.e., the number of substitutions per site. When the evolutionary rate remains approximately constant, the evolutionary distance is then supposed to be proportional to the real evolutionary time. The synonymous distance *K*<sub>S</sub>, the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, is such candidate that synonymous substitutions would not incur the change of amino acid and are thus regarded as neutral, which according to the neutral theory should occur in constant rate. Given a model of gene family that allows the gene to duplicate and get lost in a fixed rate, one can derive that the probability density function of the *K*<sub>S</sub> age distribution of retained gene duplicates is a quasi-exponential function that most retained gene duplicates are recently borned with ~0 age while as the age going older the associated number of retained gene duplicates decay quasi-exponentially. Therefore, the occurance of large-scale gene duplication events, for instane WGDs, with varied retention rate, will leave an age peak from the burst of gene duplicates in a short time-frame upon the initial age distribution, and can be unveiled from mixture modeling analysis. However, WGDs identified from the paralogous *K*<sub>S</sub> age distributions can only inform the WGD timing in the time-scale of that specific species, which is not comparable in the phylogenetic context. Only with the orthologous *K*<sub>S</sub> age distributions, which convert the estimated body from paralogues to orthologues and inform the relative timing of speciation events, can we decipher the phylogenetic placement of WGDs after proper rate correction. `wgd v2` is such program that helps users construct paralogous and orthologous *K*<sub>S</sub> age distributions and realize both the identification and placement of WGDs.
